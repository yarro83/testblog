## netguru RoR - test blog

Hello stranger! You have just taken your first step on your adventure with programming in Ruby. We are proud of you! Now, we challenge you to complete the following task. Ready, steady...

Follow the instructions:

1. clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:netguru/testblog.git`
2. install an appropriate Ruby (2.0) - we recommend using [RVM](https://rvm.io/) - and run the command `bundle`
3. launch the app and take a look around (`bundle exec rails s`)
4. hmm... something is wrong here! repair broken tests:
  * `bundle exec rspec`
  * please don’t fork a repo.. yet 
  * each fixed spec = 1 commit to your repo
  * attention: do not modify specs but the application code only!
5. I see that you're doing great! When all specs are green - put the project on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) (starter guide available [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/rails3))
6. copy the link to the application running on Heroku and [drop us a line](mailto:jobs@netguru.pl) - don’t forget to provide us with links to both - the app and your GitHub account 
7. You did it! [Well done!](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dlddnkWJ38Q/T-gwMiX6D_I/AAAAAAAAAMk/UQnpWE1ZpMI/s1600/the-very-best-of-the-success-kid-meme.jpg) Soon we'll let you know the results!

And in the meantime...
